## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: `5 stories committed, 3 story done`
- Total points committed vs. done: `27 story points committed, 21 story points done`
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): `82h hours planned, 82h 15m hours spent`

### Detailed statistics

_Note_: _all the numbers below are computed considering only the new tasks added in this sprint.
In fact we manually counted the real estimated/actual hours for sprint 1 uncompleted stories (HT-2 and HT-3), because YouTrack automatically moved all the tasks uncompleted, from sprint1 to sprint2 board. 
We created new tasks for the uncompleted stories, to better estimate the additional hours needed to complete them, but we also keep the old tasks to not lose all the commits and hours tracked._


| Story  | # Tasks       | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   8 (6 new)   |        |     22     |   21h 45m    |
| _2_    |   7  (2 new)  |    5   |     8      |     11h      |
| _3_    |   10 (2 new)  |    8   |     7      |   15h 30m    |
| _4_    |   5           |    8   |     17     |   16h 30m    |       
| _5_    |   5           |    3   |     14     |   11h 30m    |       
| _6_    |   5           |    3   |     14     |     6h       |

| TOT    |   40 (25 new) |   27   |     82h    |   82h 15m    |


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):

      estimated avg = 3,28 h
      actual avg = 3,29 h
      
      estimated standard deviation = 1,889
      actual standard deviation = 2,084

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1:

      Total task estimation error ratio = 0,003 = 0,3%


## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 4h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 35
  - Coverage (if available): 88.88%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 4h 45m
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated: 4h
  - Total hours spent: 5h 30m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

      We underestimate time needed to integrate client and server. 
      Also the workload left behind from previous sprint was estimated less than necessary.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

      We understood that the amount of hours needed to complete a task is not the same for every persons. In fact task with same functionality and estimation can be completed in different time by different people. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

      We achieve a better communication between person working on the same story. We are also proud of our improvements in task planning. 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

      Our estimation activity is still far from perfection. 
      The estimation process is something that need more experience to be done correctly. 
      Also knowing the capabilities and productivity of each member can help refine the estimation. 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

      Better estimation is the priority. 
      In particular more time have to be spent in cross-task activities. 
      Productivity improvement. 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

      Good networking and relationship among members.
