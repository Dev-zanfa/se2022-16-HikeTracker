## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 5 stories committed, 3 story done
- Total points committed vs. done: 27 story points committed, 21 story points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 74 hours planned, 73,5 hours spent


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks       | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   8           |        |     14     |      17      |
| _2_    |   7  (2 new)  |    5   |     8      |      9       |
| _3_    |   10 (2 new)  |    8   |     7      |      15,5    |
| _4_    |   5           |    8   |     17     |      16,5    |       
| _5_    |   5           |    3   |     14     |      9,5     |       
| _6_    |   5           |    3   |     14     |      6       |       
    

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): 
avg = 1,83 h
deviation = 0,3356 h

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1:
| (74 / 73,5) - 1 |= - 0,006 = 0,6%


  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 4h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 35
  - Coverage (if available): 88.88%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 4h 45m
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated: 4h
  - Total hours spent: 5h 30m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

      We underestimate time needed to integrate client and server. 
      Also the workload left behind from previous sprint was estimated less than necessary.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

      We understood that the amount of hours needed to complete a task is not the same for every persons. In fact task with same functionality and estimation can be completed in different time by different people. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

      We achieve a better communication between person working on the same story. We are also proud of our improvements in task planning. 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

      Our estimation activity is still far from perfection. 
      The estimation process is something that need more experience to be done correctly. 
      Also knowing the capabilities and productivity of each member can help refine the estimation. 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

      Better estimation is the priority. 
      In particular more time have to be spent in cross-task activities. 
      Productivity improvement. 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

     Good networking and relationship among members.
