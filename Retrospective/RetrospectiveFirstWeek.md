## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 3 stories committed, 1 story done
- Total points committed vs. done: 21 story points committed, 8 story points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 87 hours planned, 90 hours spent


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   3      |       |     18       |      16        |

| 2      | 5        | 5       | 10h           | 19h         |
    

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): 
avg = 90/21 = 4,3 h
deviation: 1,538204 h

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
| (87 / 90) - 1 |= 0,03

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
We included in the sprint too many stories with large number of story points.
We also underestimated the time needed to fully complete some tasks.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Without communication between members assigned to the same story the integration time increases a lot

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
We successfully divided and distibuted better the tasks between the members.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
The planning and the estimation.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
The members of the team working on the same story should communicate more frequently.
Better planning and estimation 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
We really like the outcome of the first story and the map feature
